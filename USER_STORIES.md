This file tracks all user stories completed in the conversation processor application to ensure we maintain code quality and prevent regression of previously solved issues.

## Story #001: Memory-Efficient Mega Data Set Loading

**Problem:** 
The application was crashing in production with memory exhaustion errors when loading the mega_data_set. The system was attempting to load 367,361 rows Ã— 119 columns (~200MB+) into memory, exceeding Streamlit Community Cloud's 2.7GB RAM limit.

**Why it was important:**
- Production application was completely unusable due to crashes
- Users couldn't access any functionality that required property data
- Memory crashes were blocking the core business functionality of property matching and analysis

**Tasks accomplished:**
1. âœ… Analyzed current mega_data_set loading patterns across all services
2. âœ… Identified memory usage bottlenecks (full dataset vs essential columns)
3. âœ… Created unified `load_mega_data_set()` function with 3 modes:
   - `essential` mode: 80% memory reduction (12 essential columns vs 119 total)
   - `bairros` mode: 95% memory reduction (neighborhood-specific loading)
   - `full` mode: Legacy support with production protection
4. âœ… Updated all existing services to use memory-efficient modes
5. âœ… Added production environment detection and automatic fallbacks
6. âœ… Fixed threading issue in conversation sync worker (removed st.markdown from background threads)

**Main problems during development:**
- Different pages were using inconsistent loading patterns (full dataset vs optimized loading)
- Background thread context issues causing ScriptRunContext warnings
- Needed to maintain backward compatibility while implementing memory optimizations

**What we learned:**
- Streamlit Community Cloud has strict memory limits (~2.7GB RAM)
- Column projection can reduce memory usage by 80%+ 
- Neighborhood-based filtering provides 95%+ memory reduction
- Background threads cannot use Streamlit UI functions (st.markdown, etc.)
- Production environment detection is crucial for different optimization strategies

**Tests that confirmed completion:**
- Application loads successfully in production without memory crashes
- Essential columns mode loads ~10MB instead of ~200MB
- Bairros mode loads ~5MB for 2-3 neighborhoods 
- Legacy code continues to work without modifications
- Production environment automatically uses memory-efficient modes

**Commit message:**
```
feat: implement unified memory-efficient mega_data_set loader

- Add 3-mode mega_data_set loader (essential/bairros/full) for 80-95% memory reduction
- Block full dataset loading in production to prevent memory crashes
- Update all services to use memory-efficient essential mode by default
- Fix background thread ScriptRunContext issues in conversation sync
- Add production environment detection and automatic fallbacks
- Maintain backward compatibility with legacy loader functions

Resolves production memory crashes while preserving all functionality.
